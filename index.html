								<h1>About Me</h1>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								Hello, I'm Nathan Mukooba! I am a senior attending the University of Colorado, Boulder pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science expecting to graduate May 2024. 
								I am passionate about utlizing my creativity to problem solve and produce technologies that benefit others. I belive technology has the power to enhance accessibility. 
								As a result, I am dedicated to creating software that is user-friendly and accessible to all. I am a quick learner and am always eager to learn new technologies and languages.
							</p>
							<p><span></span>
								My experience in the tech space has primarily been through personal projects, hack-a-thons and course work. My proficiencies in languages like Python, C++, and Javascript have allowed me to become a strong developer.
								The projects I have worked on have given me experience in primarily full stack development, embeded development, and product development. A noteable project I have worked on recently is my Senior Capstone DigiClips.
								DigiClips is a web application that allowed users to search for various from of media, such as Television, Newspapers, Radio, Magazines and more. The application allowed users to search for media based on a keyword 
								and users could apply filtering to their search. I was responsible to for managing the team, organizing the requirements, communicating with the sponsors & capstone advisors, and developing the backend of the application in Angular and Typescript.
								It was a great experience and I learned a lot about project management and working with a team. More importantly, I learned how eager I am for more experiences working with teams and developing software.
							</p>
							<p> <span></span>
								When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love to cook and bake, and I am always looking for new recipes to try. I also enjoy crafting and sewing. I have recently started to learn how to embroider and I am excited to start on more sewing projects. 
								One project I am particularly excited to start on is making my first boxy hoodie from scratch. I also enjoy reading graphic novels, comics and watching movies. I am always looking for new books to read and movies to watch. 
							</p>	
							<p><span></span>
								On here you will find the work that I am most interested in and excited to share. As well as more information about some of the topics I dicussed above.
